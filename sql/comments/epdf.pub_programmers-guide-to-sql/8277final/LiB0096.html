We hope you had fun with it and were able to reinforce your understanding of many of the subjects presented throughout the book.</p>
<p class="para">The chapter started by creating the data structures to hold product catalog information. There were only four data tables, but as you could see, they were just enough for your purposes.</p>
<p class="para">The chapter continued by presenting a range of <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statements on your data. You could see the same results being returned using table joins, sub-queries, and correlated subqueries.</p>
<p class="para">The next step was to update catalog information. You saw how to add, remove, and update different pieces of data in your catalog. You also saw how to save these statements as SQL Server, Oracle, and DB2 stored procedures. The case study ended by showing a simple method of searching catalog products.</p>
