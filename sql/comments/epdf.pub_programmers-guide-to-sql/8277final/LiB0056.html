<a name="634"></a>Overview</h2>

<p class="para">Although it's generally considered to be an advanced topic, the concept of transactions is easy to understand because it models natural processes that happen in our everyday lives.</p>
<p class="para">Transactions aren't necessarily related to financial operations, but this is the simplest way to look at them. For example, every time you buy something, a transaction happens&#8212;you pay an amount of money and then receive in return the product for which you paid. The two operations (paying the money and receiving the product) form the transaction.</p>
<p class="para">Imagine that a customer called Sally wants to transfer $1,000 from her checking account to her savings account. From Sally's point of view, this operation is a single operation (<i class="emphasis">one</i> money transfer operation), but in fact inside the database something like this happens:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
UPDATE Checking
   SET Balance = Balance - 1000
   WHERE Account = 'Sally';
UPDATE Savings
   SET Balance = Balance + 1000
   WHERE Account = 'Sally';
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Of course, this piece of SQL code is a simplified version of what really happens inside a production database, but it demonstrates how a set of simple operations can form a single larger operation. In this example you have only two operations, but in reality there are likely to be many more. When you perform such a complex operation, you need to be assured it really executes as a single, atomic operation.</p>
<p class="para">This isn't as easy as it sounds because you need to make sure all the constituent operations execute successfully&#8212;if any of them don't (and this can happen because of a wide area of reasons such as operating system or database software crashes, computer viruses, or hardware crashes), the larger operation fails.</p>
<p class="para">In the bank scenario, two database operations need to happen in order to correctly transfer the money&#8212;if one of the two operations fails (say, a hardware failure happens after the first <span class="fixed">UPDATE</span>), Sally would lose $1,000. You need to find a way to ensure the two <span class="fixed">UPDATE</span> statements both either execute successfully or don't execute at all.</p>
<a name="636"></a><a name="IDX-266"></a>
<p class="para">Fortunately, modern databases have the technology to protect transactions for you&#8212;you just need to tell the database about the statements that form a transaction, and the database will do everything for you.</p>
