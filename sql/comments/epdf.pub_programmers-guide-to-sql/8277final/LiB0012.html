<h2 class="first-section-title"><a name="97"></a><a name="ch01lev1sec4"></a>Summary</h2><p class="first-para">This chapter covered the basics that are required to understand SQL. We briefly discussed how SQL works and its evolution as a global standard for database access.</p>
<p class="para">The chapter then moved on to look at exactly what's meant by the term <i class="emphasis">database,</i> as well as several concepts that together relate to the way data is stored. You saw that databases consist of tables that contain rows of data, where each row contains a single data entry that's made up of entries in several columns. You also saw that a row in a table must have a unique primary key value in order to differentiate it from other rows in the same table.</p>
<p class="para">You then learned how you can relate tables together in a relational database and the types of relationships that can exist between tables.</p>
<p class="para">Finally, you had your first look at the basics of SQL, including comment syntax.</p>
<p class="last-para">For the rest of this book, you'll look at how to use the SQL introduced in this chapter, and you'll use the terms defined in this chapter continuously. Trust us&#8212; give it a few more chapters, and these terms will be indelibly etched in your mind (if they aren't already), so there's no danger of forgetting any of them!</p>
