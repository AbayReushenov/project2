<h2 class="first-section-title"><a name="235"></a><a name="ch04lev1sec2"></a>Grouping Data</h2><p class="first-para">So far, you've only applied your aggregate functions to either all the records in a table or a filtered set. This means that if you want to get, say, summed values for subsets of data in a database, it could mean several separate queries. For example:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT SUM(UnitCost) FROM Products WHERE SupplierID = 1;
SELECT SUM(UnitCost) FROM Products WHERE SupplierID = 2;
SELECT SUM(UnitCost) FROM Products WHERE SupplierID = 3;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">And so on. Obviously, this isn't ideal. As an alternative, SQL provides a way to divide tables into groups of rows and apply aggregate functions to groups rather than all the records returned by a query. This is when using aggregate functions becomes most powerful.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="sect3-title">
<a name="236"></a><a name="ch04lev2sec5"></a>Filtering Group Data</h3>
<p class="first-para">To group data in SQL, you use the <span class="fixed">GROUP BY</span> clause, with typical syntax as follows (typical because <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> queries themselves are so variable):</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT <i class="emphasis">ColumnA</i>, <i class="emphasis">AggFunc</i>(<i class="emphasis">AggFuncSpec</i>) FROM <i class="emphasis">Table</i>
WHERE <i class="emphasis">WhereSpec</i>
GROUP BY <i class="emphasis">ColumnA</i>;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Here the values in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">ColumnA</span></i> are enumerated, and groups are created for rows with matching values in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">ColumnA</span></i>. For example, if there are 40 records with 15 different possible values in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">ColumnA</span></i>, then 15 groups will be created. This means that 15 rows are returned, each consisting of an entry for the <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">ColumnA</span></i> values they share and the result of the aggregate function applied to the rows in a group.</p>
<a name="237"></a><a name="IDX-91"></a>
<p class="para">Note that there's actually no need to return <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">ColumnA</span></i> in the query, but it tends to make sense so that you can identify the group. As with other queries involving aggregate functions, you can't include other columns in the data returned because this wouldn't make logical sense. For example:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT <i class="emphasis">ColumnA</i>, <i class="emphasis">ColumnB</i>, <i class="emphasis">AggFunc</i>(<i class="emphasis">AggFuncSpec</i>) FROM <i class="emphasis">Table</i> WHERE <i class="emphasis">WhereSpec</i>
GROUP BY <i class="emphasis">ColumnA</i>;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Each group might have several rows with <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">ColumnB</span></i> values, and because the returned rows can only show one, this query is simply too vague to be interpreted, so an error will be raised.</p>

<p class="para">The best way to look at this grouping behavior is to see an example.</p>

<p class="first-para">In SQL Server, you can also add the <span class="fixed">ALL</span> keyword to the <span class="fixed">GROUP BY</span> clause:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT <i class="emphasis">ColumnA, AggFunc(AggFuncSpec) FROM Table</i>
<i class="emphasis">WHERE WhereSpec</i>

<p class="para">If you do this, then groups will be selected from values in all the rows in the table, not just those filtered by the <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause. However, the values calculated for these groups by aggregate functions do take the <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause into account, meaning that some groups will be shown with misleading (or <span class="fixed">NULL</span>) values calculated by these functions.</p>
<p class="para">Compare the previous example with the following query:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">

</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">You now add the <span class="fixed">ALL</span> keyword, meaning that all students will be considered, even if they have no exam marks this high. The result of this is that the <span class="fixed">COUNT </span>function has no records to count for some students, hence the zero entries in the <span class="fixed">HighPasses</span> column in the results and the increased number of results returned (again, only the first four rows are shown):</p>

<a name="241"></a><a name="ch04lev2sec7"></a>Using the HAVING Clause</h3>
<p class="first-para">Suppose you want to filter your result set not by any actual value in the database but by the results of an aggregate function. For example, perhaps you want to <a name="242"></a><a name="IDX-93"></a>find out which students did particularly well or badly in their exams in general. You don't want to filter based on any particular mark but on the average mark for all exams they took. You might think this would be as simple as adding the condition to the <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark
FROM StudentExam
WHERE AVG(Mark) &lt; 50 OR AVG(Mark) &gt; 70
GROUP BY StudentID;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Unfortunately, this won't work. The <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause is used to filter data <i class="emphasis">before </i>the aggregate function is calculated, whereas you need to filter the data on the basis of the aggregate values. If you try to execute this query, you'll get an error.</p>
<p class="para">The answer to the problem (as you've probably already guessed from the heading of this section) is the <span class="fixed">HAVING</span> clause. This clause is placed after the <span class="fixed">GROUP BY</span> clause and takes the following form:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
HAVING <i class="emphasis">FilterCondition</i>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">So, to find out which students scored on average more than 70 percent or less than 50 percent in their exams, you'd use this query:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark
FROM StudentExam
GROUP BY StudentID
HAVING AVG(Mark) &lt; 50 OR AVG(Mark) &gt; 70;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">This returns the results:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
StudentID    AverageMark

------------ ------------
2            48
3            80
7            71
10           73
<a name="243"></a><a name="IDX-94"></a>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">You can also use <span class="fixed">HAVING</span> in conjunction with <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> if you want to filter the data both before and after the aggregate column is calculated. For example, let's suppose you want to restrict yourself to the results of the mathematics exams. There are three math exams, with <span class="fixed">ExamID</span> values of <span class="fixed">5</span>, <span class="fixed">8</span>, and <span class="fixed">11</span>. So your new query will look like this:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark
FROM StudentExam
WHERE ExamID IN ( 5, 8, 11 )
GROUP BY StudentID
HAVING AVG(Mark) &lt; 50 OR AVG(Mark) &gt; 70;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">The <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> filter is applied before the aggregate values are calculated, so any rows in the <span class="fixed">StudentExam</span> table where the <span class="fixed">ExamID</span> field doesn't contain one of the values <span class="fixed">5</span>, <span class="fixed">8</span>, or <span class="fixed">11</span> will be ignored completely. Once the aggregate values have been calculated, you use the <span class="fixed">HAVING</span> clause to restrict the rows returned to those students whose average over these three exams is either particularly good or particularly bad. The result of this query is as follows:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
StudentID    AverageMark

------------ ------------
2            39
10           71

<a name="244"></a><a name="ch04lev2sec8"></a>Using Top-N Queries</h3>
<p class="first-para">Sometimes, for whatever reason, you won't want to return all the rows in a database that match the filter criteria. If you only want, say, the top 10 rows, then it makes little sense to get hundreds of rows from a database and only work with 10 of them because this means that more data is being exchanged between servers, which impairs performance. All of the database systems covered in this book support ways of doing this. Unfortunately, these are all different, so you'll look at each system in turn.</p>

<p class="first-para">SQL as implemented in Microsoft SQL Server and Access allows you to choose how many rows to return using the <span class="fixed">TOP</span> keyword:</p>

<p class="para">The <span class="fixed">TOP <i class="emphasis">RowCount</i></span> section shown here can be added to any <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> query. <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">RowCount</span></i> can be an absolute number, which will be how many rows to return, or it can be a number followed by the <span class="fixed">PERCENT</span> keyword, meaning that a percentage of the total rows selected will be returned.</p>
<p class="para">In its most basic usage, the <span class="fixed">TOP</span> keyword simply returns the first matches found in a table:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT TOP 5 CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customers;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">This query would return data from the first five rows in the <span class="fixed">Customers</span> table.</p>
<p class="para">However, one important point to note here is that the top rows are snipped off after any sorting is performed. This makes it possible to select, say, the rows with the highest or lowest values in a certain column:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT TOP 10 PERCENT StudentID, Mark
FROM StudentExam
ORDER BY Mark;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">The previous query returns the bottom 10 percent of marks in the <span class="fixed">StudentExam</span> table&#8212;it's the bottom because <span class="fixed">ORDER BY Mark</span> specifies an ascending order (the row with the lowest <span class="fixed">Mark</span> value is the first one in the result set generated by the query).</p>

<p class="para">As with SQL Server, if the cut-off point comes in the middle of a group of records with the same value in the <span class="fixed">ORDER BY</span> column, the values that are (arbitrarily) placed later won't be returned from the query.</p>
<p class="para">To get around this, you need to use the <span class="fixed">RANK</span> function, which assigns a rank to every row returned by a query. <span class="fixed">RANK</span> has the following syntax:</p>
<a name="256"></a><a name="IDX-100"></a>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY <i class="emphasis">ColumnName</i> ASC | DESC)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">You use <span class="fixed">RANK</span> much like any other SQL function: to add a new column to the result set returned from the query. This column indicates what rank each row has when the results are ordered by the column named in the <span class="fixed">RANK() OVER </span>clause. For example, to add a column indicating the rank for each of the students based on the average mark they scored in the exams they took, you'd use the following query:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(Mark) DESC) AS Ranking,
        StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark
FROM StudentExam
GROUP BY StudentID;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">So, to retrieve the top four students, taking any ties into account, you just need this query with a <span class="fixed">WHERE Ranking &lt;= 4</span> clause, right? Nearly. Unfortunately, though, you can't access the computed <span class="fixed">Ranking</span> column in the same query. Instead, you need to define this query as a subquery and then query that subquery, adding the <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause to the outer query. The syntax for creating a subquery in DB2 is as follows:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
WITH <i class="emphasis">SubQueryName</i> (<i class="emphasis">SubQueryColumnList</i>)
AS (<i class="emphasis">SubQueryStatement</i>)
... <i class="emphasis">Outer query</i> ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">So, when you put all that together for your top students query, you end up with this monster of a SQL statement:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
WITH RankedMarks (Ranking, StudentID, AverageMark)
AS (
   SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(Mark) DESC) AS Ranking,
           StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark
   FROM StudentExam
   GROUP BY StudentID)
SELECT Ranking, StudentID, AverageMark
FROM RankedMarks
WHERE Ranking &lt;= 4;
</pre>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="sect4-title">
<a name="257"></a><a name="ch04lev3sec4"></a>Oracle</h4>
<p class="first-para">Finally, Oracle allows a similar query to be performed using the <span class="fixed">ROWNUM</span> keyword, where every record in a table is assigned a row number according to its position, separate from the ID of the row or any other data. This keyword, however, must <a name="258"></a><a name="IDX-101"></a>be specified in a <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause with a comparison operator, and so it isn't as flexible (and won't work with <span class="fixed">ORDER BY</span> because reordered rows maintain their original row number).</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM Customers
WHERE ROWNUM &lt;= 5;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">To get around this, you can embed your <span class="fixed">SELECT</span> statement as a subquery into an outer query, querying that subquery for the top <i class="emphasis">n</i> rows. For example, to retrieve the first five rows sorted alphabetically by <span class="fixed">CustomerName</span>, use the following:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName FROM (
   SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName
   FROM Customers
   ORDER BY CustomerName ASC)
WHERE ROWNUM &lt;= 5;
</pre>

<p class="para">Although rounding down to integers doesn't occur in this example, you still have the problem that some rows may be arbitrarily discarded if the cut-off point occurs in the middle of a group of rows with the same average mark.

<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY <i class="emphasis">ColumnName</i> ASC | DESC)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">You use this to add a new column to your subquery, containing a value for each row that indicates the rank of that row in the result set. The subquery that uses this function has the same form as the DB2 subquery:</p>

SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(Mark) DESC) AS Ranking,
        StudentID, AVG(Mark) AS AverageMark

<p class="para">To retrieve the top four placed students (taking any ties into account), the outer query just needs to retrieve all the rows from this subquery that are ranked four or less:</p>
