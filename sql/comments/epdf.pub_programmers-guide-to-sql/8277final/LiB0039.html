<p class="para">Querying data from multiple tables using subqueries is a great capability, but it doesn't always give you everything you need, and the syntax can become a bit messy and confusing. Also, as discussed in the <a href="LiB0035.html#376" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">previous chapter</a>, when a subquery executes for each match of an outer query, performance can be affected. For this reason, SQL allows you to query multiple tables simultaneously with a simpler syntax. This capability doesn't completely replace some of the techniques you saw in the <a href="LiB0035.html#376" target="_parent" class="chapterjump">previous chapter</a> involving subqueries across multiple tables, but it's extremely powerful when you simply want a result set that contains information from more than one table. Because relational databases are designed to hold data in more than one table, where records in one table are usually associated with records in other tables, this functionality is essential.</p>
<div class="highlights">
<p class="first-para">In this chapter, you'll look at the various ways that multitable queries can be performed using what's known in SQL parlance as <i class="emphasis">joins</i>. You'll start, as usual, with the basics before building up to more complex situations. The simpler material concerns situations where you get a result set consisting of matches between rows in different tables based on certain criteria, either by looking at equality between column values or by using some other comparison. The more complex techniques involve forcing unmatched rows from one or more tables to be included in the results you receive, even if there's no match with a row in another table.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="sect2-title">
<a name="420"></a><a name="ch07lev1sec1"></a>Understanding Simple Joins</h2>
<p class="first-para">Let's consider a simple example. Imagine that someone at the example university wants to know when rooms are occupied and when they're free. You could find out this information by querying the <span class="fixed">Class</span> and <span class="fixed">Room</span> tables from the sample <span class="fixed">InstantUniversity</span> database:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Class.ClassID, Class.Time, Room.RoomID
FROM Room, Class;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Unfortunately, this won't yield the results you're after. You might think that you'd simply get a set of rows that consists of all the columns for both tables, <a name="421"></a><a name="IDX-168"></a>with each row containing data from a row in the first table and a row from the second. Well, you'd be right. However, what you may not imagine is quite how many rows you'd get (try it out for yourself and see what happens!).</p>
<p class="para">Basically, the result of the join is the Cartesian product of the elements in each set. For example, the Cartesian product of the two sets <span class="fixed">{a, b, c}</span> and <span class="fixed">{a, b}</span> is the following set of pairs:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
{(a, a), (a, b), (b, a), (b, b), (c, a), (c, b)}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">What happens in this example is that each row in <span class="fixed">Room</span> is combined with each row in <span class="fixed">Class</span> to give a row in the result set. So, the first row of <span class="fixed">Room</span> is combined with the first row of <span class="fixed">Class</span> for the first row in the result set. Next, the first row of <span class="fixed">Room</span> is combined with the second row of <span class="fixed">Class</span>, then the third row, the fourth row, and so on. The number of elements in the Cartesian product is the product of the number of elements in each set. In the example, you have nine rooms and 10 classes, so you have 90 results. Taking this further, if you had 100 rooms in your university and 100 classes scheduled, you'd end up with 10,000 rows of results!</p>
<p class="para">In generic terms, imagine the following pseudoquery:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Table1.Column1, Table2.Column2, Table2.Column3 FROM Table1, Table2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Consider the situation where the previous query is executed, with the column <span class="fixed"><i class="emphasis">Table1</i>.<i class="emphasis">Column1</i></span> having the values <span class="fixed">T1C1V1</span>, <span class="fixed">T1C1V2</span>, and so on, with <span class="fixed"><i class="emphasis">Table1</i>.<i class="emphasis">Column2 </i></span>having <span class="fixed">T1C2V1</span>, <span class="fixed">T1C2V2</span>, and with the same naming scheme for <span class="fixed"><i class="emphasis">Table2</i>.<i class="emphasis">Column1</i></span>. The first few rows returned will be as follows:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
Table1.Column1  Table1.Column2  Table2.Column1
--------------- --------------- --------------
T1C1V1          T1C2V1          T2C1V1
T1C1V1          T1C2V1          T2C1V2
T1C1V1          T1C2V1          T2C1V3
T1C1V1          T1C2V1          T2C1V4
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">and so on for the rest of the rows in <span class="fixed"><i class="emphasis">Table2</i>.<i class="emphasis">Column1</i></span>. Next, you move on to the second row in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table1</span></i>:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
Table1.Column1  Table1.Column2  Table2.Column1
--------------- --------------- --------------
T1C1V2          T1C2V2          T2C1V1
T1C1V2          T1C2V2          T2C1V2
T1C1V2          T1C2V2          T2C1V3
T1C1V2          T1C2V2          T2C1V4
<a name="422"></a><a name="IDX-169"></a>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">As before, you'll get one result for each row in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table2</span></i>.</p>
<p class="para">This type of join is known as a <i class="emphasis">cross join</i>, or Cartesian product. In fact, in all the RDBMSs covered in this book, except DB2, you can write the previous as follows:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Table1.Column1, Table1.Column2, Table2.Column3 FROM Table1 CROSS JOIN Table2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">This <span class="fixed">CROSS JOIN</span> operator is the SQL-92 standard.</p>
<p class="para">In some circumstances, you might want this to happen but not many. What you need to do is to specify which rows in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table1</span></i> should be joined with which rows in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table2</span></i>. The way you tend to do this is to use table relationships. For example, you might stipulate that a row with a primary key value of <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">x</span></i> in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table1</span></i> is joined to a row with the same foreign key value in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table2</span></i>.</p>
<p class="para">That way you might end up with 100 rows if there was a one-to-one correlation, or perhaps even less, if for example you were only joining a filtered group of rows in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table1</span></i> to a filtered group of rows in <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">Table2</span></i>.</p>
<div class="section">
<h3 class="sect3-title">
<a name="423"></a><a name="ch07lev2sec1"></a>Using Two Table Equi-Joins</h3>
<p class="first-para">The most common way of associating rows from one table to another is via an <i class="emphasis">equi-join</i>. This is where you link rows based on an equality (hence "equi") between the values contained in a column of each row:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Table1.Column1, Table1.Column2, Table2.Column3 FROM Table1, Table2
   WHERE Table1.Column1 = Table2.Column2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">As with cross joins, you can also express this using a more explicit keyword form, which is the SQL-92 standard and works for all current versions of the RDBMSs covered in this book:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Table1.Column1, Table1.Column2, Table2.Column3FROM Table1 JOIN Table2
   ON Table1.Column1 = Table2.Column2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Here, the difference is that you use the <span class="fixed">JOIN</span> keyword rather than a comma and <span class="fixed">ON</span> rather than <span class="fixed">WHERE</span>. Because this is the standard form, you'll be using it in subsequent example code.</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="note">
<tr>
<td valign="top" class="admon-check"></td><td valign="top" class="admon-title">Note </td><td valign="top" class="admon-body">
<p class="first-para">For this example syntax to work on all database platforms and produce the same results, <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">JOIN</span></i> may have to be replaced by <i class="emphasis"><span class="fixed">INNER JOIN</span></i>. You'll see this in action in the upcoming example.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<a name="424"></a><a name="IDX-170"></a>
<p class="para">Returning to the rooms and classes example, if you use the following SQL code, you'll see a much smaller result set:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Class.ClassID, Class.Time, Room.RoomID
FROM Room
   JOIN Class ON Room.RoomID = Class.RoomID;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">You now see just 10 rows, one for each class, indicating what time and in which room each class is held.</p>
<p class="para">You should note that versions of Oracle up to 8.1.7 don't support the <span class="fixed">JOIN </span>keyword. Instead, simply use the following syntax:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Room.RoomID, Class.Time, Class.ClassID
FROM Room, Class
WHERE Room.RoomID = Class.RoomID;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">As another example, if you had a table called <span class="fixed">Customers</span> with a <span class="fixed">CustomerID </span>column and a table called <span class="fixed">CreditCards</span> that also had a <span class="fixed">CustomerID</span> column (going back to an earlier example where you had multiple credit cards per customer), you might write the following:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT Customers.CustomerID,
        Customers.CustomerName,
        CreditCards.CardNumber
FROM Customers
   JOIN CreditCards
   ON Customers.CustomerID = CreditCards.CustomerID;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">Assuming there's a one-to-many relationship between these tables (one customer can have multiple credit cards), you'd get one row returned for each credit card in <span class="fixed">CreditCards</span>. Note that some of these rows would have identical customer information because this is how you've asked for the data.</p>

</table>
<p class="first-para">Say you want to report the marks that have been achieved for every exam taken by every student. The following query will do the trick. Execute it against the <span class="fixed">InstantUniversity</span> database:</p>
<div class="informalexample">

<p class="para">Note that to run this example with MySQL and Access, you need to use <span class="fixed">INNER JOIN</span> instead of <span class="fixed">JOIN</span>:</p>

<p class="last-para">In this example, you've joined data from <span class="fixed">StudentExam</span> directly to data from the <span class="fixed">Student</span> table and presented it in a single result set. Rather than getting the <span class="fixed">StudentID</span> value and having to then extract student names, joining the tables with the equi-join specification of <span class="fixed">ON StudentExam.StudentID = Student.StudentID</span> gives you direct access to this information. This is much more efficient because you get the information you want without having to run a separate query or, as might be the case, several separate queries for each student.</p>

<p class="para">Again, instead of using the <span class="fixed">JOIN</span> clause in this example, you could have constructed the same query using <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clauses as follows:</p>

</div>
<p class="para">Another point to note is that this type of join, and in fact any other type of join, can include additional clauses as examined in other chapters. A <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause, for example, is just as valid in a join as in any other query. The following modification to the previous example gives just those students with a mark of 80 or more:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT StudentExam.ExamID,
        StudentExam.Mark,
        Student.Name AS StudentName

WHERE StudentExam.Mark &gt;= 80
ORDER BY ExamID;

<a name="428"></a><a name="ch07lev2sec2"></a>Using Multitable Equi-Joins</h3>
<p class="first-para">When it comes to equi-joins, there's no need to stop at two tables. You can include as many tables as you like, taking care to match rows to one another to avoid obtaining thousands of rows. To do this, you simply add another <span class="fixed">JOIN</span> and <span class="fixed">ON </span>clause after the first one:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT * FROM <i class="emphasis">Table1</i> JOIN <i class="emphasis">Table2</i>

<p class="para">To go back to the customers and credit cards example, imagine that you have another table called <span class="fixed">Addresses</span>, where each customer has one or more addresses stored. You could expand on the query to get columns from this new table with simple additions:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">

<p class="first-para">All equi-joins use the equality operator (<span class="fixed">=</span>) in their <span class="fixed">WHERE</span> clause. However, this is by no means essential. You can use any comparison operator you like, for example:</p>

(these times don't appear in this list). This is a bit of a crude way to identify if a room is actually free (the only times that appear are times when there are classes). However, it does at least demonstrate, in this database, how using an inequality operator instead of an equality operator produces many more results because the search is broader in this case.</p>

<p class="first-para">The example queries you've seen so far have had one thing in common&#8212;they all tend to be rather long. However, the aliasing technique you've used previously in this book really comes into its own here. For example, you can rewrite the query used earlier:</p>
<a name="439"></a><a name="IDX-178"></a>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT StudentExam.ExamID,
        StudentExam.Mark,
        Student.Name AS StudentName
FROM StudentExam
   JOIN Student
   ON StudentExam.StudentID = Student.StudentID
ORDER BY ExamID
</pre>
</div>
<p class="para">using aliases as so:</p>
<div class="informalexample">
<pre class="literallayout">
SELECT SE.ExamID,
        SE.Mark,
        S.Name AS StudentName
FROM StudentExam AS SE
   JOIN Student AS S
   ON SE.StudentID = S.StudentID
ORDER BY ExamID
</pre>
</div>
<p class="last-para">The query operates in the same way, but you save a fair bit of space, making the important bits easier to read along the way.</p>
