<TR><TD VALIGN="Top"><p>Do you speak SQL? We do, and in this book we provide you with an in-depth yet concise tutorial on using Structured Query Language (SQL), the standard that defines how to create and manipulate databases and the data they store. SQL is a simple yet powerful language, and you&#8217;ll be amazed at how many things you can do with just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We teach you all the basic concepts and provide practical examples relevant to your daily programming tasks. Once you&#8217;ve mastered the fundamentals, this book will serve you well as a handy reference on SQL usage. It covers all the major SQL statements you&#8217;re likely to need when programming databases and provides example code for five major database systems: SQL Server, Oracle, DB2, MySQL, and Access. In each case, we demonstrate how the database system vendor implements, and often extends, the SQL standard.</p>
<p>We finish off with two complete, real-world case studies that pull together many of the concepts presented throughout the book. We show how to create and query the underlying database for an e-commerce application, as well as how to implement role-based security in your applications.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re just starting out with SQL, working with an unfamiliar database, or in need of a desktop reference, this book will provide you with the help and information you need to build effective database applications.</p>
