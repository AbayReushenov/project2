<p class="para">This case study has been all about building a RBS system. At the beginning of the chapter, we talked about how implementing a RBS system provides you with an easier way to maintain security than if permissions were mapped individually to each user. We also talked about how providing a <span class="fixed">Mode</span> value gives you the ability to extend and scale your system to meet additional security demands without having to modify your data structure or severely impact the code of an application written against your system.</p>
<p class="para">When you got into the implementation of the system, you saw the data structures that make up the system you're building, and you looked at all of the stored procedures that you needed to create in order to provide a full set of services to any application written against your database.</p>
<p class="para">By now you should have a firm grasp of the functionality and features involved in building RBS systems, as well as some of the SQL data design and query techniques that get that job accomplished. The sample presented in this chapter should serve as a good starting point for any RBS system that you might want to implement in your own solution.</p>
