<p class="first-para">You might just want to tell us how much you liked or loathed the book in question. Or you might have ideas about how this whole process could be improved. In either case, you should e-mail &lt;<a href="mailto:support@apress.com"><span class="fixed">support@apress.com</span></a>&gt;. Please be sure to mention the book's ISBN and title in your message. You'll always find a sympathetic ear, no matter what the problem is. Above all you should remember that we do care about what you have to say, and we will do our utmost to act upon it.</p>

<p class="first-para">Obviously with an ever-growing range of books and an ever-changing technology base, there's an increasing volume of data requiring support. Although we endeavor to answer all questions about the book, we can't solve bugs in your own programs that you've adapted from our code. However, do tell us if you're especially pleased with the routine you developed with our help.</p>
