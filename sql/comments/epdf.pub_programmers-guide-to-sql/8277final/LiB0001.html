<b class="bold">CRISTIAN DARIE</b> is an independent IT consultant specializing in Microsoft technologies. Having worked with computers since he was a child, he won his first prize at the age of 12 in the first programming contest he ever entered. He was actively involved with the former Wrox Press as a technical reviewer and author, having contributed the OOP parts of <I>Visual C# .NET: A Guide for VB6 Developers</I> and coauthored <I>Beginning ASP.NET E-Commerce with Visual Basic .NET and Visual Studio .NET</I>. He has authored MCAD preparation material and various SkillDrill tests, such as C# Programming, Microsoft COM+, and DB2 Development, which can be taken at <a target="_top" class="url" href="http://www.skilldrill.com"><span class="fixed">http://www.skilldrill.com</span></a>.</p>

<b class="bold">KARLI WATSON</b> is a freelance author and IT specialist with a penchant for multicolored clothing. He started out with the intention of becoming a world-famous nanotechnologist, so perhaps one day you might recognize his name as he receives a Nobel Prize. For now, though, Karli's computing interests include all things mobile and everything .NET. Karli is also a snowboarding enthusiast and wishes he had a cat.</p>
<p class="first-para">
<b class="bold">JULIAN SKINNER</b> studied Germanic etymology before joining the former Wrox Press. He has consequently spent most of the last four-and-a-half years reading, editing, and writing books about programming, focusing on Microsoft technologies and, in particular, on C# and the .NET Framework. He contributed many sections and code samples, and often entire chapters, for the books he worked on at Wrox, mostly hiding behind the relative anonymity of an "additional material" credit, but he is credited as a coauthor of, among other titles, <I>Professional ADO.NET</I>.</p>

<p class="first-para">
<b class="bold">CHRIS HART</b> is a developer and author based in Birmingham (in the United Kingdom, not Alabama). Chris spent most of the last four years as a member of the technical editorial team at the former Wrox Press and has been programming on a variety of systems since the age of 10. She spends most of her time working with Microsoft technologies and has been heavily involved with .NET since it was first released as an early alpha preview. She's currently working for Business Post and is developing .NET Compact Framework/SQL CE applications and 2D barcode scanning components in Delphi.</p>
<p class="first-para">
<b class="bold">KEVIN HOFFMAN</b> started programming at the age of 10 when his grandfather gave him a Commodore VIC-20 that he refurbished, and he's been addicted to programming ever since. He has worked on everything from writing interfaces for scientific instruments to building e-commerce Web sites to providing second-tier technical support for Unix. He got hold of .NET when it was first handed out in early pre-beta form and has been coding with it ever since. He's currently employed in Houston, Texas, where he creates enterprise applications with the .NET Framework for a financial services company.</p>
